# ISS_
So first the astronauts on ISS say something we should notice :  'We want to come home, but there's still work to do' 1. 2. they say they don't feel like castaways. 3 . ISS should be already be equipped with big safe parachutes . The move  of the ISS should be like getting rid of extras  entering the capsule and using the parachute they should be able to land. If there are no parachutes it could be a problem and there would need to be a second attempt from a mission on earth...yet if they have to stay in order to finish up processes my opinion is they should stay there for a little while.. The program here sets a CPU Usage counter on the ISS  which is the ISS into parts
